# SMK Negeri Website - Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the SMK Negeri website to ensure quality, reliability, and performance across all components.

## Testing Principles

### Quality Goals

- **Usability**: Intuitive and accessible user experience
- **Performance**: Fast loading times and responsive interactions
- **Security**: Protection against common vulnerabilities
- **Compatibility**: Consistent behavior across devices and browsers
- **Reliability**: Stable operation under expected load conditions

### Testing Approach

- **Shift-Left Testing**: Integrate testing early in the development process
- **Automated Testing**: Maximize test coverage with automated scripts
- **Continuous Testing**: Run tests automatically in CI/CD pipeline
- **Risk-Based Testing**: Prioritize testing based on business impact
- **User-Centered Testing**: Validate features with real user scenarios

## Test Environment

### Development Environment

- Local development machines
- Docker containers for consistent environments
- Mock services for external dependencies
- Feature flags for gradual rollouts

### Staging Environment

- Mirror of production infrastructure
- Real database with anonymized data
- Integration with actual external services
- Performance testing capabilities

### Production Environment

- Live production systems
- Real user data and traffic
- Monitoring and alerting systems
- Rollback capabilities

## Testing Types

### Unit Testing

**Objective**: Validate individual components and functions in isolation

**Coverage Targets**:

- 80%+ code coverage for backend services
- 70%+ code coverage for frontend components
- 100% coverage for critical business logic

**Tools**:

- Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript testing
- React Testing Library for frontend components
- Supertest for API endpoint testing

**Examples**:

```javascript
// Example unit test for a user service function
describe('UserService', () => {
  describe('createUser', () => {
    it('should create a new user with valid data', async () => {
      const userData = {
        username: 'testuser',
        email: 'test@example.com',
        password: 'password123',
      };

      const result = await UserService.createUser(userData);

      expect(result).toHaveProperty('id');
      expect(result.username).toBe('testuser');
      expect(result.email).toBe('test@example.com');
    });
  });
});
```

### Integration Testing

**Objective**: Validate interactions between integrated components

**Scope**:

- API endpoints and their database interactions
- Authentication and authorization flows
- Third-party service integrations
- Data flow between frontend and backend

**Tools**:

- Jest with Supertest for API testing
- Cypress for end-to-end integration flows
- Mock services for external dependencies

### End-to-End (E2E) Testing

**Objective**: Validate complete user workflows from frontend to backend

**Key User Journeys**:

1. User registration and login
2. Student dashboard access and navigation
3. Teacher grade submission workflow
4. PPDB application submission
5. News article publishing and viewing
6. File upload and download processes

**Tools**:

- Cypress for web application testing
- TestCafe as an alternative E2E framework
- BrowserStack for cross-browser testing

**Example Test Scenario**:

```javascript
// Example E2E test for student login
describe('Student Login Flow', () => {
  it('should allow students to login and access dashboard', () => {
    cy.visit('/login');
    cy.get('[data-testid="email-input"]').type('student@example.com');
    cy.get('[data-testid="password-input"]').type('password123');
    cy.get('[data-testid="login-button"]').click();

    cy.url().should('include', '/student/dashboard');
    cy.get('[data-testid="dashboard-title"]').should(
      'contain',
      'Student Dashboard'
    );
    cy.get('[data-testid="user-menu"]').should('be.visible');
  });
});
```

### Accessibility Testing
