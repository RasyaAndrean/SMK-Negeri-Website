## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- PostgreSQL database (for server)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd smk-negeri
   ```

2. Install dependencies for both client and server:
   ```bash
   # Install all dependencies
   ./install-all.bat
   
   # Or install individually
   cd client && npm install
   cd ../server && npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in both client and server directories
   - Update the values according to your environment

### Development

1. Start the development servers:
   ```bash
   # Start both client and server
   ./dev.bat
   
   # Or start individually
   cd client && npm run dev
   cd server && npm run dev
   ```

2. Access the applications:
   - Client: http://localhost:3000
   - Server API: http://localhost:8000
   - API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/api-docs

### Production

1. Build the applications:
   ```bash
   # Build both client and server
   ./build.bat
   
   # Or build individually
   cd client && npm run build
   cd server && npm run build
   ```

2. Start the production servers:
   ```bash
   # Start both client and server
   ./start.bat
   
   # Or start individually
   cd client && npm start
   cd server && npm start
   ```
